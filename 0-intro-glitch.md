## Learn to get back to your project after you sign out

After you have "Remixed" the course project, let's see how you can go back to it after you log out.

1. Log out

3. Locate your project

You are now back at the editor.

## Glitch editor
The Glitch editor is a simple file editor. 

1. You can see a list of files on the left 
2. Clicking a file will open it in the file editor to the right
3. There is also an "Assets" folder for putting media files

## Learn the structure of the course files

The project you have Remixed contains all the examples and lessons.

If you scroll the file list to the left you will see:

1. Assets. This is a special folder in Glitch. If you click it, you will see various images inside it. Do not delete these images because they are being used by the Examples and Lessons.

1. Examples. Inside the "folder" `examples/`. These are the most important files for the course and the ones you will edit or copy to create your own.

2. Course lessons. These are files that end in `.md`. You should not edit these, although there is no big problem in doing so because the course lessons can always be read in the original course site at https://aframe-usj.glitch.me/index.html

3. Additional files. Files ending in `.js`, `.json`, or `.css` these are helper files that you should not change or delete. 
  1. **In particular, the file `server.js` is important so do not delete it or change it.**


## Making changes and seeing the result
Let's now see how to make changes and how to see the result.

### Add an asset
Let's start by adding an asset. Look for an image in your computer and upload to the `Assets` in Glitch by following these steps:

1. Go to the Assets folder

2. After you have uploaded the image click on it
<img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/80978ab7-9db6-45ae-bc43-4fab16bdbb6e%2Fglitch-clickasset.png?1524560994646" width="600" height="400">

3. Copy the URL of the image
<img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/80978ab7-9db6-45ae-bc43-4fab16bdbb6e%2Fglitch-copyurl.png?1524561014025" width="600" height="400">

We will now use this URL to change a simple example and see the result with your image on it.

### Edit a file
Let's edit the file that creates the following example so that is displays the cube with the image you have just uploaded:
:::example 00-intro-01

1. Follow the steps in the picture:

### View the results

To view a specific file on your browser you just need to append the file's name to the address of your Glitch project:

1. Click on the "Show Live" button at the top of the Glitch Editor

2. On the browser tab that will open, replace `index.html` by the file name
